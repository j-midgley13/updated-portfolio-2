## Objectives  

```md
Update the readme to provide a professional portfolio to show to potential employers.
```

## Process  

* I first copied the old portfolio repository into a new repository.  
* I updated the link to the resume. It now opens a new window with options to print.  
* I then began reorganizing the portfolio page.  
* I added more projects to the portfolio page.  
* I then updated some styling for the pictures on portfolio and profile picture.  

## Challenges  

This assignment was not as challenging as past assignments. More of a fill assignment to just make sure we are keeping up being employer-ready. 

## Summary  

This assignment was fun to go back and look at past code to improve upon it. I had things that I can see now that makes sense such as matching styling options that I definitely didn't see before.
